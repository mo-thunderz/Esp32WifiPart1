# Arduino/ESP32 Wifi Part1
Here some simple code to get started with Wifi on a Arduino with integrated WiFi (tested on an ESP32). NOTE: the ESP32 only supports 2.4G networks. 5G networks will not be seen by the ESP32.

# ESP32WifiShowNetworks.ino
This is a simple program by Techtutorialsx that scans the available Wifi networks and reports these in the Serial monitor. In addition, it will login onto a hard-coded SSID with password defined in the code.

# ESP32WifiNtp.ino
This code reads out an NTP clock to sync time. Code is based on the link below, but adapted to work on ESP32.
